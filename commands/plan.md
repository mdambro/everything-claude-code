description: Restate requirements, assess risks, and create step-by-step implementation plan. WAIT for user CONFIRM before touching any code.

# Plan Command

This command invokes the **planner** agent to create a comprehensive implementation plan before writing any code.

## What This Command Does

1. **Restate Requirements** - Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface potential issues and blockers
3. **Create Step Plan** - Break down implementation into phases
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - MUST receive user approval before proceeding

## When to Use

Use `/plan` when:
- Starting a new feature
- Making significant architectural changes
- Working on complex refactoring
- Multiple files/components will be affected
- Requirements are unclear or ambiguous

## How It Works

The planner agent will:

1. **Analyze the request** and restate requirements in clear terms
2. **Break down into phases** with specific, actionable steps
3. **Identify dependencies** between components
4. **Assess risks** and potential blockers
5. **Estimate complexity** (High/Medium/Low)
6. **Present the plan** and WAIT for your explicit confirmation

## Example Usage

```
User: /plan I need to add real-time notifications when markets resolve

Agent (planner):
# Implementation Plan: Real-Time Market Resolution Notifications

## Requirements Restatement
- Send notifications to users when markets they're watching resolve
- Support multiple notification channels (in-app, email, webhook)
- Ensure notifications are delivered reliably
- Include market outcome and user's position result

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema
- Add PostgreSQL migrations for notifications and user notification preferences using the project's denormalized, query-oriented data model
- Add indexes for the expected access patterns (such as user and delivery status)

### Phase 2: Domain and Application
- Define notification domain types and invariants
- Add application use cases and repository/notification-provider ports
- Define retry and idempotency behavior for delivery

### Phase 3: Rust Infrastructure
- Implement Axum handlers and SQLx repository adapters
- Connect the resolution event to the notification use case
- Use Tokio for asynchronous delivery; introduce a durable queue/outbox only if delivery guarantees require it

### Phase 4: Frontend Components
- Add notification views and preferences to the Flutter client
- Deliver live updates through authenticated and authorized Axum WebSocket connections

## Dependencies
- Rust, Tokio, Axum, SQLx, and PostgreSQL
- Email service (SendGrid/Resend)
- Add a durable queue or outbox only when delivery guarantees require it

## Risks
- HIGH: Email deliverability (SPF/DKIM required)
- MEDIUM: Performance with 1000+ users per market
- MEDIUM: Notification spam if markets resolve frequently
- LOW: WebSocket connection lifecycle and reconnect behavior

## Estimated Complexity: MEDIUM
- Backend: 4-6 hours
- Frontend: 3-4 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Total: 9-13 hours

**WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION**: Proceed with this plan? (yes/no/modify)
```

## Important Notes

**CRITICAL**: The planner agent will **NOT** write any code until you explicitly confirm the plan with "yes" or "proceed" or similar affirmative response.

If you want changes, respond with:
- "modify: [your changes]"
- "different approach: [alternative]"
- "skip phase 2 and do phase 3 first"

## Integration with Other Commands

After planning:
- Use `/tdd` to implement with test-driven development
- Use `/build-and-fix` if build errors occur
- Use `/code-review` to review completed implementation
